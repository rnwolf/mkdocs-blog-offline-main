# PyCCPM

Python library for Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM).


## Introduction

Both Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) and Agile are project management methodologies to deal with the uncertainly in delivering work.

They have different approaches and to dealing with uncertainty.

## Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)

CCPM focuses on `resource` (Usually people or hardware) *constraints* and *buffer* management to deliver projects efficiently. It was developed by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt and is an evolution of traditional project management methods.

**Main benefits of CCPM:**

- Emphasizes realistic scheduling by removing individual task safety buffers and placing them at the project level
- Manages resource constraints explicitly by identifying the "critical chain" of resources
- Reduces multitasking that can slow down overall progress
- Uses buffer management to provide early warning signals for project delays
- Works well for projects with clearer scope and deliverables

CCPM is designed to address common problems in traditional project management like student syndrome (delaying work until deadlines), Parkinson's Law (work expanding to fill available time), and poor multitasking practices.

## How to learn about CCPM?

Python is a freely available development tooling.  This Python library will make it easy for people to apply locally and learn about CCPM.
