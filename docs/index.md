# Welcome

Hello, and thanks for stopping by.

This is my personal corner of the web — part blog, part portfolio, and part digital journal. Here you'll find a record of things I've built, ideas I've explored, and lessons I've learned along the way.

Whether you're a colleague curious about my latest work, a recruiter exploring what I bring to the table, or just someone who shares similar interests, I hope you'll find something here that resonates.

This site is as much for my past and future self as it is for anyone else — a place to reflect on progress, revisit past curiosities, and capture ideas in motion.

<p>A useful collection of information for those starting of wingfoiling.  There is so much information and much of it does not seem to be relevant until you have mastered the basics.  This is my collection of stuff that seems most relevant as a beginner.</p>

<p>Hi there! You are reading this on my website created with a application called <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>. My previous much prettier website was based on <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, which is great for content rich websites like this personal blog but I found that when upgrading components it resulted in a broken websites. MkDocs is is less cutting edge and more stable.</p>
