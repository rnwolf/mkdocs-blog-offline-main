# About

Based in the United Kingdom, working as a delivery manager, helping teams use technology to make a positive difference in the world. Married to a school teacher with two children. My latest interest in learning to Wing Foil in the local lake.

## What I Do

### Lead and Motivate Teams

I don't work alone. I lead high-performing teams, fostering collaboration, keeping everyone motivated and removing obstacles that might slow down progress.

### Plan and Manage

I help the team break down goals into actionable steps, create alignment on approach and plans to deliver. Manage resources to ensure team has what they need to get work done.

### Communicate

Delivery managers support open transparent channels of communication between the team, stakeholders (clients, management, product or service users), and any other parties involved. Helping to keep everyone informed of progress, concerns and managing expectations throughout the product or service lifecycle.
