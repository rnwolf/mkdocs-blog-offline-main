# New Cloudflare Worker for Newsletter Sign-Up co-developed with Claude AI

I recently added a newsletter sign-up form to my static website blog using Cloudflare Workers co-developed with Claude.ai.
The process was straightforward, allowing me to implement a feature in a technology that I don't have a sound understanding of.

## Context

Artifical Intelligence (AI) is the new **Hotness** in the tech world and its seems set to have a profound impact on many industries. In the last decade I have worked on enterprise __digital transformation__ assignments.
In order to stay relevant, I need to keep up with the latest trends and technologies.
Last week (May 2025) Dario Amodei — CEO of Anthropic, a big player in the field of artificial intelligence [posted](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic) a warning for all of us.

AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years.

To remain relevant in the jobs market I need to keep up with what AI can do and how it can help.

I read a lot and shared references to the stuff I thought was interesting. Over the years I have frequently been asked if I had an email newsletter so that friends and colleagues could subscribe.

## The Problem

To keep my technology stack simple, I have a static website blog hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
Adding a newsletter sign-up form to a static website is not straightforward.
I could use a third-party service, but I wanted to keep the solution simple, secure and self-hosted.

I decided to use a Cloudflare Worker to handle the newsletter sign-up form submission.
But I had never written a Cloudflare Worker before in Typescript, the preferred language for Cloudflare Workers.

## The Solution

Use Claude AI to help me write the Cloudflare Worker code.
While I don't get paid professionally to write code, one of my superpowers has been to use code to automate and help with data analysis for the teams and products I have been managing.
I do have a lot of experience in software development and have been coding since the 1980s. I did study computer science at university as part of my engineering degree.

## The Implementation

To keep things simple I used _Claude.ai_ the browser interface to interact with Claude 4. Not _Claude Code_ which is a separate product that is designed to integrate with an IDE.

From my readings I learnt that to get the best results from AI you need to provide it with a lot of context.

1.  I started by writing a prompt that described the problem I was trying to solve.
