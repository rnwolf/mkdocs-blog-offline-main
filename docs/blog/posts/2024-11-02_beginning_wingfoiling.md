# References for beginning wingfoiling

A useful collection of information for those starting of wingfoiling.  There is so much information and much of it does not seem to be relevant until you have mastered the basics.  This is my collection of stuff that seems most relevant as a beginner.

## Equipment for beginner

Start on a windsurfer board, that is very stable in the water so that you do not need to concern yourself with having to balance and float while trying to get to grips with learning to use the wing.

Learn to:

* turn the wing
* paddle while towing the wing
* kneel on board with wing up and moving
* stand up with wing up

## Wind strength

A good wind strength for learning to wing foil is between

* 15 and 20 knots
* 28 and 38 km/hr
* 8 and 10 meters per second
* 17 and 23 miles/hr

## Wind direction

The optimal wind direction to learn wing foiling is cross-shore wind. A wind that blows parallel to the shoreline.

## Sailing direction relative to wind direction

## Turning or Jibing

After you figure out how to get up or fly on a wing foil, you need to learn how to turn around and go back again.
