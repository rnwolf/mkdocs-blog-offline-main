# Technology

The **Technology** category takes a broader view of innovations and their impacts.

While Development focuses on how software is built, Technology examines what's being built across the entire tech landscape and why it matters. This category explores emerging technologies, industry trends, hardware innovations, and the societal implications of technological change.
These posts balance enthusiasm for innovation with critical thinking about technology's role in shaping our futureâ€”looking at both the tools themselves and the bigger questions they raise about how we live, work, and interact.
